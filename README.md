# Ocaml-Practice
Just wanted to learn [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language. Take a look at [lib](lib) directory.

## Usage
Install Ocaml with [The official guide](https://ocaml.org/install#linux_mac_bsd). Then in the project root:
```bash
# build project
make

# run executable
make run

# enter utop (ocaml repl)
make utop

# clean
make clean
```
